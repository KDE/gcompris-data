# About the voice files

This directory contains GCompris voice files for Norwegian Nynorsk.

The files were generated using the commercial CereVoice Cloud
text-to-speech service from CereProc: https://www.cereproc.com/

Most files were generated using the Hulda-CereWave voice, but a
few were generated using the Hulda voice.
